    "## 1. Motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For final project in Social Data Analysis & Visualization, the most open-ended specification one could possibly explore was given as a scenario to work on. Our take towards the project was something ambitious, and wanted to do something that could be easily viewable or noticable by viewers. Later, it was decided to design project around Covid-19 data because, it felt very topical being that it is the subject of the time and pretty much the only thing on all of the minds. It was imperative to offer something unique to the World that nobody seemed to be doing. Eventhough, there are lot of real-time visualization pages available already. There are rare pages talking about the _Risk & environmental factor_ or stating comparisons between the _previous outbreaks trend_. The desire to do something novel, something that would challenge us as an analyst and showcase some, out of the box ideas infront of the World which can be accessible on easily available platform without previous context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to follow a structure for Part-B of the project, here is link to our Part-A video of the project: [The impact of Covid-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--AMiwuPjLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "While the sources are on the front lines, reliably presenting people with vital information and helping them to stay informed on all things pertaining to this crisis, our goals are slightly different, as outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goals:**\n",
    ">1. Use a potential data source to gain insights into the pandemic from unique contexts.\n",
    ">2. Create an overview with the topic **_Global Impact of Covid-19_** and showcase the trend of cases, deaths & recoveries with respect to certain time period.\n",
    ">3. _Risk factor & Environmental factor_ are other important things, report is focused on.\n",
    ">4. Generic trend in between previous pandemic outbreaks is supposed to be illustrated comparing the `Covid-19` data to the likelyhood of **SARS**, **H1N1** & **Ebola**."

    ">3. Viewer will get to know an idea about the `risk factor` & `environmental factor` in correlation to the Covid-19 situation.\n",
